This project is a web application for appointment scheduling.

Project Environment:
- It was built in Apache environment and I used Xampp for this.
- It uses SQLite database for storing and fetching appointment information.
- Default port of Apache is 80. So if you add this project in htdocs folder in Xampp, you can access the page using http://localhost/ApexTestProject/
- JQuery has been used for event handling and form validation.
